# sxgd - Srynetix' Godot Extensions

My personal collection of Godot Engine nodes and extensions.

> **Note**: It is available for Godot 3.x and 4.x, you can find the 3.x version in the `godot-3.x` branch, and the 4.x version in the `main` branch.  
> Work will mostly be ongoing on the `main` branch, so for Godot Engine 4.x.

You can view all included stuff in the [documentation](https://srynetix.github.io/sxgd/).  
There is a testing project around sxgd, the [sxgd kitchen sink](https://github.com/Srynetix/sxgd-kitchen-sink).
