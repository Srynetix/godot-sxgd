# sxgd - Srynetix' Godot Extensions

My personal collection of Godot Engine nodes and extensions.

You can view all included stuff in the [documentation](./docs/readme.md) section.

It is organized in the following structure:

- [Extensions](./docs/extensions/readme.md): Static methods and related utilities for any part of the engine,
- [Modules](./docs/modules/readme.md): Specific modules separated from the rest, like the FontAwesome icons integration,
- [Nodes](./docs/nodes/readme.md): Reusable nodes, separated by category (debug, ui, utils, etc.),
- [Tests](./tests): Some tests you can play with. Tests are also contained in [modules](./docs/modules/readme.md).
